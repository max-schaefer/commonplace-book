# Latin in CodeQL

This is an exploration of encoding Latin morphology in CodeQL. In order to run
the code, you need to select a database. It doesn't matter what's in the
database, so you can use any CodeQL database you have lying around.
Alternatively, use the empty database in the `db` subdirectory.
