# Anselm of Canterbury

## Monologion

- 60: "The Father is consciousness, the Son understanding, and the Spirit, love."
- 66: "The efficacy of the mind's ascent to knowledge of the supreme nature is in direct proportion to the enthusiasm of its intent to learn about itself. And, insofar as it forgets to look to itself, it falls from its reflection on the supreme nature."

## Proslogion

- 1: "I do not seek to understand so that I may believe, but I believe so that I may understand. For I believe this also, that unless I believe, I shall not understand."
