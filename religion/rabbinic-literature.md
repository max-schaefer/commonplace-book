# Snippets from Rabbinic Literature

## Babylonian Talmud

### [Berakhot 17a.5](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.5?lang=bi)

> The Gemara recounts that when Rav Sheshet would sit in observance of a fast, after he prayed he said as follows:
> Master of the Universe, it is revealed before You  that when the Temple is standing, one sins and offers a sacrifice.
> And although only its fat and blood were offered from that sacrifice on the altar, his transgression is atoned for him.
> And now, I sat in observance of a fast and my fat and blood diminished.
> May it be Your will that my fat and blood that diminished be considered as if I offered a sacrifice before You on the altar, and may I find favour in Your eyes.

### [Berakhot 17a.12](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.12?lang=bi)

> In the World-to-Come there is no eating, no drinking, no procreation, no business negotiations, no jealousy, no hatred, and no competition.
> Rather, the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads, enjoying the splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And they beheld God, and they ate and drank.”

## Vayikra Rabbah

### [Vayikra Rabbah 9.7](https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.9.7?lang=bi)

> Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Levi, and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Menaḥem of Galya: In the future, all the offerings will be abolished but the thanks offering will not be abolished. All the prayers will be abolished, but the thanksgiving will not be abolished. That is what is written: “The sound of gladness and the sound of joy, the sound of a groom and the sound of a bride, the sound of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts…” (Jeremiah 33:11), this is the thanksgiving; “bringing thanks offerings to the House of the Lord” (Jeremiah 33:11), this is the thanks offering. Likewise, David says: “I will fulfill the vows I made to You; I will pay thanks to You” (Psalms 56:13). _Toda_ is not written here, but _todot_, thanksgiving and a thanks offering.
