# Brilliant translations in the Vulgata

Over the centuries, the Vulgate has come under frequent criticism for its inaccuracies and inconsistencies. I'm sure a lot of this criticism is justified, but here are a few examples where I find its renderings exquisitely precise, sometimes more so than modern translations.

## Genesis 1

Throughout Genesis 1, the Hebrew text uses two different verbs to describe the making of the world, "ברא" and "עשה". The first verb, "ברא", is used in three places: verse 1 (creation of heaven and earth), verse 21 (creation of animal life) and verse 27 (creation of man, three times in one verse). The second verb, "עשה", is used for other acts, perhaps indicating that they are less of a breakthrough and more of a gradual unfolding. The Vulgate (like modern translations, but unlike the LXX) follows this nuance carefully, using "creare" for "ברא" and "facere" for "עשה".

At the end of Genesis 1:5, the Hebrew text has "יום אחד", "one day", which is subtly different from the following days: "יום שני", "second day" (1:8), "יום שלישי", "third day" (1:13), etc. The Vulgate again follows this distinction, translating "יום אחד" as "dies unus" and the others as "dies secundus", "dies tertius", etc. While some translations are equally careful (e.g., LXX, RSV, YLT and Buber-Rosenzweig), others translate "first day" and thereby lose the distinction (e.g., the KJV, NIV and ESV).

## Exodus 25

The instruction to build the Ark of the Covenant is given in the plural, whereas for the mercy seat, the lampstand and other items the singular is used. The Vulgate preserves this distinction, while the Septuagint does not.

## Psalm 19

In the translation of verse 12 (or 13 in the Hebrew numbering), almost all English translations (including the JPS) render "שְׁגִיא֥וֹת מִֽי־יָבִ֑ין" as "Who can understand his errors?" or variations thereof. But as a few translations indicate by italicisation, the "his" is not in the Hebrew text. The Vulgate (and following it the Douay-Rheims, but also the LXX and the YLT) is more precise, translating "delicta quis intelligit" or "errores quis intelleget" (depending on the psalter).
