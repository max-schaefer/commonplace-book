## Episode 222: Did The Vatican Just REVERSE Its View On Mary?

Only tangentially related to the episode's main thrust (which I appreciate and approve of), Joe mentions the Proto-Evangelium of Genesis 3:15 as a locus classicus for Mary as the New Eve. Again, I appreciate and approve. But then he claims that the Masoretic Text's use of "זרע" for "seed" is a hint at the Virgin Birth, since normally we only hear of the "seed" of male characters in the Old Testament. Interesting, but sadly incorrect: not long after, in Genesis 4:25, Eve calls her third son "Seth" because "God has appointed for me another _seed_ instead of Abel", and in Genesis 24:60, Rebecca's family blesses her saying "let thy _seed_ possess the gate of those who hate them". I'm sure there are more instances, but those two should suffice to show that "seed" can refer to the progeny of either sex.
