# Snippets from the Babylonian Talmud

## [Berakhot 17a.5](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.5?lang=bi)

> The Gemara recounts that when Rav Sheshet would sit in observance of a fast, after he prayed he said as follows:
> Master of the Universe, it is revealed before You  that when the Temple is standing, one sins and offers a sacrifice.
> And although only its fat and blood were offered from that sacrifice on the altar, his transgression is atoned for him.
> And now, I sat in observance of a fast and my fat and blood diminished.
> May it be Your will that my fat and blood that diminished be considered as if I offered a sacrifice before You on the altar, and may I find favour in Your eyes.

## [Berakhot 17a.12](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.12?lang=bi)

> In the World-to-Come there is no eating, no drinking, no procreation, no business negotiations, no jealousy, no hatred, and no competition.
> Rather, the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads, enjoying the splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And they beheld God, and they ate and drank.”
