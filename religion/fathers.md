- Chapter 2: "You shall not hate any man; but some you shall reprove, and concerning some you shall pray, and some you shall love more than your own life."
- Chapter 3: "The workings that befall you receive as good, knowing that apart from God nothing comes to pass."
- Chapter 4: "In the church you shall acknowledge your transgressions, and you shall not come near for your prayer with an evil conscience."
- Chapter 5: "And the way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnesses, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness."
- Chapter 6: "For if you are able to bear all the yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, what you are able that do."
- Chapter 7: "And conceringt baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit in living water."
- Chapter 8: "But let not your fasts be with the hypocrites; for they fast on the second and fifth day of the week; but fast on the fourth day and the Preparation (Friday)."
- Chapter 9: "But let no one eat or drink of your Thanksgiving (Eucharist) but they who have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, Give not that which is holy to the dogs."

- Chapter 14: "But let no one that is at variance with his fellow come together with you, until they be reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be profaned."
- Chapter 15: "And reprove one another, not in anger, but in peace, as you have it in the Gospel."

## The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians

- Chapter 1: "For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you."
- Chapter 2: "Ye mourned over the transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own."
- Chapter 3: "For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world."
- Chapter 4: "If thou offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast though not sinned? Be at peace; thine offering returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it."
- Chapter 5: "Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him."
- Chapter 6: "Envy and strife have overthrown great cities and rooted up mighty nations."
- Chapter 7: "These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of your duty, but also to remind ourselves."
- Chapter 8: "Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations]."
- Chapter 9: "Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will; and imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless labours, and strife, and envy, which leads to death, let us turn and have recourse to His compassions."
- Chapter 10: "[Abraham], in the exercise of his obedience, went out from his father's house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God."
- Chapter 11: "On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom when all the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus making it manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from Him to punishment and torture."
- Chapter 12: "Moreover, they gave [Rahab] a sign of this effect, that she should hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus they made it manifest that redemption should flow through the blood of the Lord to all of them that believe and hope in God."
- Chapter 13: "Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and fooishness, and angry feelings."
- Chapter 14: "Let us be kind one to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our Creator."
- Chapter 15: "Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness, and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it."
- Chapter 16: "For if the Lord thus humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of His grace?"
- Chapter 17: "Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and sheep-skins went about proclaiming the coming of Christ."
- Chapter 18: "But what shall we say concerning David, to whom such testimony was borne, and of whom God said, 'I have found a man after Mine own heart, David the son of Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I annointed him?'".
