# From the Church Fathers

## The Didache

- Chapter 1: "There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways."
- Chapter 2: "You shall not hate any man; but some you shall reprove, and concerning some you shall pray, and some you shall love more than your own life."
- Chapter 3: "The workings that befall you receive as good, knowing that apart from God nothing comes to pass."
