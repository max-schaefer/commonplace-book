# From the Church Fathers

## The Didache

- Chapter 1: "There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways."
- Chapter 2: "You shall not hate any man; but some you shall reprove, and concerning some you shall pray, and some you shall love more than your own life."
- Chapter 3: "The workings that befall you receive as good, knowing that apart from God nothing comes to pass."
- Chapter 4: "In the church you shall acknowledge your transgressions, and you shall not come near for your prayer with an evil conscience."
- Chapter 5: "And the way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnesses, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness."
- Chapter 6: "For if you are able to bear all the yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, what you are able that do."
