# Brant Pitre: The Case for Jesus

Pitre makes a forceful case for the historical reliability of the gospels, and especially their authorship by apostles and their associates. He pushed back against the widely held opinion that the gospels circulated anonymously for a hundred years or so and were only later attributed to their traditional authors to lend them credence, instead arguing that they were unanimously believed to have been written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John from the earliest times.

Many of his arguments make a lot of sense to me, especially the comparison the the Letter to the Hebrews, which really is anonymous and whose authorship has been controversial from the beginning. No such controversy surrounds the gospels (says Pitre).

What I really don't understand, though, is the main plank of his argument, namely that no anonymous copies of the gospels have ever been found.

As far as I know even the oldest New Testament papyri date from the year 200 AD or later, which is after the (allegedly) spurious attributions had already been added, so we wouldn't _expect_ them to be anonymous.

But more importantly, the very first entry in the [List of New Testament papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Testament_papyri) on Wikipedia, [ùîì<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_1), a fragment of the beginning of Matthew's gospel, does, in fact, appear to be anonymous! Here is how the text starts according to the Wikipedia page (which matches the accompanying photograph of the papyrus):

> Œ±

> Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒøœÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÉŒµœâœÇ ŒôŒ• ŒßŒ• Œ•Œ• Œ¥Œ±œÖŒπŒ¥ [Œ•Œ•]
>    Œ±Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ±Œº

In other words, we dive right into chapter 1, verse 1, without any title or mention of an author, no "ŒöŒ±œÑŒ± ŒúŒ±Œ∏Œ∏Œ±ŒπŒøŒΩ" or anything. I can't see anything missing from the top of the papyrus either.

In his search for an anonymous copy of the gospels, did Pitre really not think to look at "Papyrus 1"? Or does he consider it irrelevant for some other reason? It is really quite puzzling.

I did enjoy other parts of the book, though, especially the connection between the blood and water coming from Jesus' side and Josephus' account of the blood of the temple sacrifice being disposed of in the Kidron valley, causing a stream of blood and water to flow from the temple. This made the significance of Jesus' body as the new temple much clearer to me.

I also found the explanation of the "Sign of Jonah" very enlightening: Pitre contends that Jonah actually died when the fish swallowed him and was raised from the dead when he was spit out after three days, before proceeding to preach to the (gentile) Ninevites and converting them, even if temporarily. This combination of death and resurrection after three days followed by a conversion of the gentiles, Pitre claims, is what the Sign of Jonah refers to, and is fulfilled by Jesus on a much grander scale.
