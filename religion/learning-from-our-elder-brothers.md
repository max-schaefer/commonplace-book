# Learning from our Elder Brothers

A collection of notes on the Tanakh gleaned from Jewish podcasts.

## Sources

Links are given to Spotify, but the podcasts are also available on other platforms.

**Alex Israel's [Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4Qu9OF1UY1Zia0zBMoCw7v?si=b87a56d76cf442fc)**: lecture style, one episode per chapter (10-15 minutes), starting from the Book of Joshua. Fairly accessible and high-level, with carefully chosen references to other parts of the Tanakh, the Talmud, the writings of the Jewish sages, and modern archaeological and historical insights.

**Jonathan Livi's [Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/45srXeZZgZKHAomOmpIkmh?si=0405a8b93eb24591)**: recordings of live classes on the weekly Torah portion and the corresponding Haftarot, with lots of attention paid to the details of the Hebrew text. The episodes are longer (20-30 minutes for weekday classes, 60-90 minutes on Sundays) and include a lot of audience interaction. Less academic in style than Alex Israel's podcast. Livi is unfortunately given to lengthy ill-informed diatribes on historical, cultural and political topics, but there are enough nuggets to make it worth bearing with the noise. I find his Maimonedean approach to Midrash particularly interesting: he neither dismisses it as useless legend nor takes it as literal truth, but rather seeks to interpret it as an indirect comment on the text pointing out connections and subtleties that might otherwise be missed.

**Levi Avtzon's [Daily Tanach](https://open.spotify.com/show/4zyiplVj4IX9mT34gFqioE?si=g-ZDNj57SKSu1E-dSfezOg)**: fairly straightforward high-level read-through of the Tanakh with a bit of commentary, about 10 minutes per episode. Freely mixes in Midrashic material.

All three podcasts are squarely aimed at a Jewish audience and make frequent use of Hebrew terms and concepts; the attached [Hebrew cheatsheet](hebrew-cheatsheet.md) may be helpful. Christian listeners should be prepared for occasional hurtful (and again not terribly well-informed) comments about our religion, but I find the insights are worth the occasional discomfort.

## Genesis

### Parashah Bereshit (Genesis 1:1-6:8)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6klJChBjk4JQn5cfZB5muG?si=SAsse_mkTWKVJ63h5UgI4A) points out a fascinating grammatical detail of the creation narrative: the making of the heaven and the earth in v. 1, of animals in v. 21 and of man in v. 27 use the Hebrew verb ברא, while the other events use the verb אשה. One explanation is that the former indicates creation of something entirely new ex nihilo, while the latter is more of an actualisation of something that was already there in potentia. So for example the various structures of the firmament, the sea and the land were already present in the creative act of the first day and only had to be drawn out, and the making of plants similarly was only a gradual unfolding, while the creation of animals with their sensitive soul presents a radically new step, as does the creation of humans with their rational soul. This distinction is clearly captured in the Vulgate, which uses _creare_ for ברא and _facere_ for אשה. The Septuaguint (sadly but unsurprisingly) does not, using ποίεω for both.

On the whole I cannot recommend listening to this episode, however: Livi, like many others before him, takes it upon himself to critique the theory of evolution and, again like many others before him, mostly ends up revealing his own ignorance of even high-school level science. (Did you know that plants are not alive, for example?)

[Another episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ftahn1vQI4cBFj9erjiZp?si=f4uVcrpxQ2yrfQgiC711Qw) of the Parashah Podcast makes a fascinating observation on the question God asks Adam after the Fall: "Where are you?" The Hebrew is "אַיֶּכָּה" (ayekah), and the same wording is used in two other places in the Torah: God asks Cain "Where is Abel your brother?" (Genesis 4:9), and Isaac asks his father "Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" (Genesis 22:7). In all three cases, the question is not so much about the location of something but about the reason for its absence, asking for an explanation rather than information.

### Parashah Lekh Lekha (Genesis 12:1-17:27)

In Genesis 14:23, the Malbim has an interesting take on the phrase "lest you say, 'I have made Abram rich'", understanding "you" not as a reference to the King of Sodom, but rather to Abram's hand (which he has just raised to God in a vow): the victory, and hence the spoils, are not due to Abram's own strength, but to God's help.

## Exodus

### Parashah Terumah (Exodus 25:1-27:19)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1UpDsdabywQyc11onGMUi1?si=7af05dd606134aef): The instructions to build the altar and the table are given in the singular, whereas the instruction to build the ark is in the plural.[^1] In Midrashic interpretation, the altar is associated with the High Priest and the table with the king, of which there is only one each; the ark, on the other hand, is associated with the Torah, which is for everyone.

[^1]: So also in the Vulgate, but interestingly not in the Septuagint, which has the singular in all three cases.

### Parashah Ki Tisa (Exodus 30:11-34:35)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VjuzVqGKOmgzuUzewYd9l?si=w1SOst7TQKOIW1zua0jg9g): "As for the man Moses" (Exodus 32:1) may be a realisation on part of the people of Israel that Moses is not a God after all. Steeped in Egyptian culture, they may have assumed that Moses was a God like Pharaoh, and the realisation that he was not sent them looking for a replacement.

"Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt" (Exodus 32:7) harks back to the story of the Flood, where "all the people on the earth had corrupted their ways" (Genesis 6:12). In both cases God decides to destroy the people and start over with Moses/Noah, but unlike Noah, who just accepted God's decision and the destruction it entailed, Moses argues with God and convinces him to change his mind.

The thirteen attributes of God (Exodus 34:6-7): note that all of them are spiritual attributes, not physical ones (as perhaps a pagan deity might have), and they focus on God's interaction with humans, not his power over the natural world.

When God says he will punish the children of the wicked to the third and fourth generation, he is not saying that he will punish the children for the sins of the parents, but that the consequences of the parents' sins will be felt for generations. Thus, this is no contradiction to Ezekiel 18:20, which says that the son will not bear the punishment for the father's sin.

### Parashah Vayakhel (Exodus 35:1-38:20)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1TZiaLjHEznDT4ZzLgN20O?si=fFJmsb3JQFGSKiZHswR0Uw): The (repeated) command to keep the Sabbath says to refrain from work ("melakha"), but does not define what work is. However, that same word is used in the description of the building of the tabernacle, so the rabbis have inferred that the work forbidden on the Sabbath is the same as the work done to build the tabernacle.

## Leviticus

### Parashah Tzav (Leviticus 6:1-8:36)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iM0oj0CGiviomsOfDfRZF?si=o7g0u_C2S4u67fcojAncSQ): Leviticus 8:23: "Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot." The first word "vayishkhat"/"and he slaughetered" has a [shalshelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalshelet) on the last syllable. This is one of the rarest cantillation marks in the Torah. It expresses hesitation, and is used only four times in the entire Tanakh. It is used here because this is the last time Moses acts as the high priest before Aaron takes over.

### Parashah Emor (Leviticus 21:1-24:23)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2cP9x7O5pBGuZtGNJ1jwDP?si=TasKyyAYQjuKEGgvNNemlA) mentions a fascinating halakhic interpretation of Leviticus 21:4. This cryptic verse comes at the end of a list of people whose funeral a priest is allowed to attend and thereby become ritually unclean, namely his close relatives. The verse itself is apparently very difficult to translate, but Young's Literal Translation makes it "A master [priest] doth not defile himself among his people -- to pollute himself". The rabbis learn from this that a priest is not allowed to attend anyone else's funeral (except for the aforementioned close family) if other people are present, but conversely he is still required to bury a dead body if no one else is present to do it (Met Mitzvah), since then he is not "among his people".

I think this sheds an intriguing light on the Parable of the Good Samaritan. I once heard a well-meaning preacher explain that we all misunderstand the point of the parable, and Jesus is not actually criticising the priest for not attending to the injured man, since he might be dead and as a priest he is forbidden from touching a dead body. This felt wrong to me, since in context it seems quite clear to me that Jesus is taking the priest (and the Levite) to task for precisely this. And I think the halakhah backs this up: clearly by the time the priest came by no one else was present at the scene of the crime, so he would have been allowed and indeed required to help the injured man or bury him if he was dead.

### Parashah Bekhukotai (Leviticus 26:3-27:34)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6DV2zpV3ROIY7EFsnDrAeI?si=YCmQhQ-eR7aHg93WIXqZYQ): The two main blessings at the beginning of Chapter 26 are agricultural and progenitorial plenty; this echoes the two curses at the end of Genesis 3, which are agricultural scarcity and painful childbirth. And just as God was said to walk with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, so the promise is that He will walk with the Israelites in the land of Canaan.

## Numbers

### Parashah Naso (Numbers 4:21-7:89)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7gEv1vufThYx97Us2cuEBk?si=vcNYPdU3T2-4aoC5aBDkdw): The commandment in Numbers 5:2 to "put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead" may seem a little surprising. While Leviticus 13:46 states that lepers need to leave the camp, the same is not true of those with other forms of ritual impurity. Rashi explains that the three different groups mentioned here are forbidden from entering different parts of the camp: those who ritually impure due to touching a dead body are not allowed to enter the tabernacle (innermost part of the camp), those with an emission are not allowed into the Levite camp (the next ring out), and lepers are not allowed into the non-Levite camp (the outermost ring).

### Parashah Beha'alotekha (Numbers 8:1-12:16)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0BTX9qInwPY12HsU52iBGx?si=Ks4cmi8_RtGnMS2MmOLQFA): Numbers 10:33 mentions that the Ark of the Covenant went _before_ the Israelites, while further up it says that it was in the middle of the people. A simple explanation is that it went in the middle during their normal desert wanderings, but at this point the Israelites thought they were just about to enter the Promised Land, so it went in front to lead the way and defeat their enemies (as later happened at Jericho).

This explanation is more frugal, but also much less colourful, than the tradition referenced in the [Daily Tanach](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1DoDueBzrue867j0gP5vaG?si=YBnpyeQMQX6TNEagoUtvJg) that there were, in fact, _two_ Arks: one that went in front (containing the first, broken set of tablets) and one that went in the centre (which is the one that sat in the Mishkan).

Further on in Numbers 11:5, the Israelites fondly reminisce about the fish they ate in Egypt [חִנָּ֑ם](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/2600.htm), i.e., "for nothing" or "for free". This seems like a strange case of warped memory, since they were slaves in Egypt and had to work for everything they got. But there is a fascinating alternative explanation: maybe they mean that back then they did not have to observe any mitzvot, so they could eat whatever they wanted without having to worry about kosher laws.

### Parashah Hukkat (Numbers 19:1-22:1)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0LQq2jc6rce5ctbhkdo0Dp?si=tGtHpUsBQG-aPa7yBbsVxA) has an intriguing comparison of the two episodes where Moses brings forth water from a rock, the other of course being Exodus 17. In the earlier episode, Moses is told to strike the rock with his staff; he does so, and water comes out. In the later he is told to take his staff, but _speak_ to the rock. Instead he strikes it, and is punished for this by being forbidden from entering the Promised Land. The kind of modern commentator I am used to would jump upon this apparent doublet as a prime example of the Torah being a composite work, weaving together multiple traditions in a somewhat haphazard fashion. We might also wonder about the apparent harshness of the punishment: hitting the rock instead of speaking to it seems like a very minor infraction. But the Parashah Podcast offers a different perspective: the first time Moses is talking to the generation that left Egypt, who have proven themselves to be not yet mature enough to enter the Promised Land. Moses takes the role of a strict disciplinarian dealing with an unruly band of teenagers who need to be rebuked sternly, and who need their miracles to be accompanied by concrete symbolic actions. The second time, however, he is talking to a new generation who have grown up in the freedom of the desert. God wants him to treat them differently, emphasising the power of words over semi-magical objects and actions. Instead, Moses again treats them like obstreperous children ("you rebels") and decides on his own to hit the rock. This is a sign that _he_ is not ready to lead them into the Promised Land, and so his not being allowed to enter Israel is not a punishment but a natural consequence of his own choices. (Livi's presentation is somewhat marred by his fondness of the term "slave mentality" which I find quite revolting, but the idea itself is interesting.)

Throughout the whole parashah, the podcast identifies a theme of demystifying objects that may seem to have magical powers and instead demonstrating that it's not these objects themselves that do the miracles, but God acting through them: the ashes of the red heifer purify, but also make the purifier unclean, so it's not the ashes themselves that have power, it's God working through them; Moses is asked to speak to the rock, not hit it with his staff, to show that the staff itself is not a magical object, but a conduit for a divine miracle; the snakes that attack the Israelites are juxtaposed with the bronze image Moses makes to heal them, showing that the snake itself can either be a source of death or a source of life, depending on God's will. A further interesting parallel is drawn with the snake in the Garden of Eden: the snake itself is not the source of evil, it's the sin that is the problem.

In the story of the fiery snakes, the episode quotes an opinion that the proper translation of Numbers 21:6 should begin "and the Lord _released_ fiery snakes" rather than "sent" them: the snakes were already there, but God had been protecting the Israelites from them. When they complain about being abandoned, he withdraws his protection to make them realise how much he had been doing for them without them noticing. My Hebrew is not good enough to judge the accuracy of this claim, and I haven't been able to find a translation that uses "released" instead of "sent", but it's a fascinating idea.

Finally, the podcast notes that in the confrontation with the king of Arad, the Israelites for the first time take the initiative and pray to God for success without obvious intervention from Moses. This is a sign of their growing maturity and independence, and a further indication that they are ready to enter the Promised Land.

### Parashah Balak (Numbers 22:2-25:9)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3u9SlqOTGVJtKFLnCKPrrq?si=_LAJcUeARgmI5RG1q5pblg) cites an opinion of the Ramban whereby the four prophecies of Balaam relate to, respectively, the period of the patriarchs, the exodus from Egypt, the time of King David, and the future coming of the Messiah. The latter agrees with Christian tradition, which sees in Balaam's final prophecy a prediction of the coming of Jesus.

## Deuteronomy

### Parashah Shoftim (Deuteronomy 16:18-21:9)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5N5TwDqKyDas5jKp9Rck42?si=T02ea08uRF-RG2Oqg1KlGQ): Deuteronomy 20:10-18 describes the rules for war. It contains three stipulations:

1. Before attacking a city, a peace offer must be made. If the city accepts, it becomes a vassal state, and the people are spared.
2. If the city does not accept, it is to be besieged, and if it falls, all men are to be killed, but women and children may be spared.
3. This only applies to cities "at a distance"; "the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance" are to be destroyed completely, leaving no one alive.

The question is what "this" in Rule 3 refers to: does it only apply to Rule 2, or to both Rule 1 and Rule 2?

In the latter case, there is no peace on offer for the Canaanites at all, they must be destroyed. This is the opinion of Rashi.

In the former case, the Canaanite cities first have to be offered peace. Only if they do not accept are they to be besieged and obliterated. This is the opinion of Ramban. He seeks to prove this from the fact that Moses offered peace to the kings of the Transjordan, though one might consider this to be a weak argument, since it's not clear that they belong to "the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance". It also accords with the statement in Joshua 11:19 that "except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites", which one could interpret to imply that peace would have been offered if they had asked for it. However, the story of the Gibeonites throws doubt on this interpretation, since before concluding a peace treaty with them the Israelites first ask them where they come from, and only accept after they have been tricked into believing that they come from a faraway land. If a peace offer had been on the cards anyway, it is not clear why they would have asked this.

The opinion of Rashi is what I have more generally heard in Christian interpretation. To a modern mind Ramban's interpretation is undeniably more palatable, but I wonder whether it is not just the easy way out.

## Parashah Ki Teitzei (Deuteronomy 21:10-25:19)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0JgpIj1cBT9tkDaesutjyD?si=Fhld6Z9cSF-10ALD2dz4XQ) discusses a curious Gemara on the Mitzvah of sending away the mother bird before taking her eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6-7): [Berakhot 33b.16](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.33b.16?lang=bi) says that anyone who prays that God should have mercy on him like on the mother bird should be silenced. Some suggest that this is because the prayer assumes that the reason for the mitzvah is mercy on the mother bird, but this is presumptuous: we cannot know the reasons for the mitzvot, or whether they even have reasons at all, so this prayer is an undue rationalisation and therefore dangerous.

## Parashah Vezot Haberakhah (Deuteronomy 33:1-34:12)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/36SAMTBHr50OJUqMKZWXWH?si=_UeM9nPZTEaFpn7-Bf1FPw) discusses a beautiful Gemara building upon the idea that Moses was buried by God himself ([Sotah 14a.3f](https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.14a.3)): "Rabbi Khama (...) says: What is the meaning of that which is written: 'After the Lord your God shall you walk (...)?' Is it actually possible for a person to follow the Divine Presence? Hasn't it already been stated: 'For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God', and one cannot approach fire. (...) Rather, the meaning is that one should follow the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He. He provides several examples. Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: 'And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them', so too should you clothe the naked. Just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, visits the sick, as it is written with regard to God's appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: 'And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre', so too should you visit the sick. Just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, consoles mourners, as it is written: 'And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son', so too should you console mourners. Just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, buries the dead, as it is written: 'And He buried him in the valley', so too should you bury the dead." I find the idea of God Himself performing what the Christian tradition calls the Corporal Works of Mercy very touching.

## 2 Kings

### Chapter 2

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QGxEug5Y4uuNqlTbXj3aJ?si=425b35b426444c00): When Elisha asks Elijah in v9 to "let me inherit a double portion of your spirit", he is asking to be treated as the firstborn. Elijah had many disciples (as this chapter shows) who, as his spiritual children, inherit his spirit, but Elisha gets a double portion of the inheritance.

### Chapter 19

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0KKL9E29oRa51ntcVl5Emy?si=db2139acc45a47aa): Sennacherib’s siege of Jerusalem is described on the Taylor Prism, where he says that he shut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem like a "caged bird". Now cf Isaiah 31:5: "Like birds hovering overhead, the Lord Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it." (NIV) For more than 2000 years one would have read this as a bland, general association of birds with freedom, but thanks to modern archaeology we can now see that it was perhaps a pointed rebuttal of Assyrian propaganda.

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YKK7DRi0P5LnUINTUsTVM?si=r0XiFMuxQ8Gg32VmSNCKpg) brings down a fascinating little Midrash on why Sennacherib was killed by his sons: he was planning on sacrificing them to the gods in order to show his compassion with the many Assyrians who had lost their sons in the failed conquest of Jerusalem, but they found out and killed him first. Perhaps I'm being overly influenced by Game of Thrones, but I wouldn't have thought that there needed to be a particular reason for a king to be assassinated by his sons. (This episode of the podcast is a particularly unfortunate example of the puerile political discourse Livi and his students like to engage in, so the first half is best skipped.)

## Chapter 20

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5QHW11KtnQvgCLGzso9HXw?si=YA_WPRNyTmGGrCt1TguO8w) mentions a funny Midrash explaning why the Babylonian king Merodach-Baladan reached out to Hezekiah: it was the king's custom to sleep until the ninth hour of the day. One day he awoke around 3pm as was his custom, but the sun was still high in the sky, having gone back ten steps as a sign of Hezekiah's miraculous healing. At first, Merodach-Baladan was furious with his servants, thinking they had let him sleep through the night and into the next morning, but when he found out about the astronomical miracle that had occurred and ascertained that Hezekiah was the cause, he sent him a letter and a gift.

The story ends on a sombre note: this would have been Hezekiah's chance to extol the greatness of God, but instead he shows off his own wealth and power, thereby setting a train of events in motion that would lead to the Babylonian exile. If not for this misstep, the rabbis say, Hezekiah could have been the Messiah.

## Psalms

### Psalm 144/145

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1GRj4SirUudsz300qsd5AK?si=YVbmqiOiRQS6Zw9vWs8ZcQ&t=657) mentions a pronouncement ascribed to Rabbi Avina in the Talmud ([Berakhot 4b][https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en]) that anyone who recites this psalm three times a day is guaranteed a place in the World to Come. They further point out that in the overall acrostic structure of the psalm, verses 11-13, beginning with the Hebrew letters כ-ל-מ respectively, each mention the word "kingdom" (מלוכה), and of course כלמ is מלכ ("king") spelled backwards.

A student on the Tehillim Podcast gives a fascinating explanation of the qere וּגְדֻלָּתְךָ (for וּגְדֻלּוֹתֶיךָ) in verse 6: by turning the plural into a singular, the psalmist is saying that God's greatness is not just a collection of great things, but a single, indivisible whole.

## Isaiah

### Chapter 7

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3vCN4T36fGN4bDzkDEbB3V?si=32db0f76a9224334): "That verse" is simply interpreted as an emphasis that the threat of a combined Aramean/Northern invasion will go away very soon: a woman will give birth to a child, and before that child is old enough to choose right over wrong, the enemies’ country will be devastated. It’s an elegant interpretation, but I feel like a bit too much is said about the child for it to just serve as a measure of time.

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XcjnkWavUev8DQd6ykWS0?si=U1xLkTy0Tze2cCGTiXR9Hw), on the other hand, cites an opinion of the Radak according to whom the miracle consists in the mother (on her own) choosing the child's name to be what the Lord revealed in the prophecy. She is therefore identified with the "prophetess" mentioned later on in the chapter.

### Chapter 45

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pWu90kkz6QijLYzVB05d2?si=OGjjYFcBQHyMSl-XKOnTZA): In the [Cyrus Cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder), Cyrus describes his victory over the Babylonians, and his repatriation of exiled peoples (not, however, mentioning Israel explicitly). The king ascribes his victory to Marduk, which is often contrasted with the biblical picture of Cyrus as a tool of God, and indeed taken to refute it. But note verse 4: "I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor, _though you do not acknowledge me_." (NIV) The prophet is fully aware that Cyrus does not worship the God of Israel, but he is still God's instrument.

(One might quibble with Alex Israel's comments on the dualistic nature of the Babylonian religion made in the same podcast: I think he is mixing up the Babylonians with the Persians.)

### Chapter 57

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2t5xL9kSbU9f402CBY8CrY?si=Ke-OEYE2TnuCeD4mmpIA7w): Interesting Talmudic passage about the righteous vs the repentant sinner ([Berakhot 34b.22](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.34b.22?lang=bi)), quoting the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu "who holds that penitents are superior to the righteous": "In the place where penitents stand, even the full-fledged righteous do not stand, as it is stated: 'Peace, peace upon him who is far and him who is near.' Peace and greeting is extended first to him who is far, the penitent, and only thereafter is peace extended to him who is near, the full-fledged righteous." As a Christian, one might be reminded of the parable of the lost sheep.

## Hosea

### Chapter 8

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6oBBL9YRJmXrPDTCrnXPO8?si=UQyv5HrlSNOiRZSV_J-eAw): Verse 12: "I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something foreign." This is usually interpreted to mean that the Israelites did not keep the Torah, but there is a fascinating alternative interpretation in the Talmud ([Midrash Tankhuma, Ki Tisa 34](https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Ki_Tisa.34.1?lang=bi)): "when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses 'Write thou' [_sc._ the Torah], Moses wanted to write the Mishnah as well. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that ultimately the nations of the world would translate the Torah into the Greek language and would claim: 'We are the Israelites.' Now the scales are balanced (as to who are His people). The Holy One, blessed be He, can say to the nations of the world: 'You claim that you are My children, but I know that only those who know My secrets are My children. Where are His secrets (to be found)? In the Mishnah, which was given orally, and from which everything can be derived. (...) Why do you wish the Mishnah to be written? What would be the difference, then, between the peoples of the world and Israel?'"

Intriguing as this interpretation is, one might object that it wasn't "the nations of the world" who translated the Torah into Greek; after all, the Septuagint predates Christianity by a couple of centuries and was prepared by Jews.

## Job

### Chapter 18

Bildad's rhetorical question in 18:4 "You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake?" is cited by the Talmud ([Berakhot 1:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Job.18.4?lang=bi&p2=Ein_Yaakov_(Glick_Edition)%2C_Berakhot.1.20&lang2=bi)) in a story about two friends who prayed together at the synagogue, and one of them left after finishing his prayers without waiting for the other. His prayers, the Talmud says, are torn to pieces.
