- pg. 1: "During the major part of the Middle Ages and for most people living in that era, the Ten Commandments did not function as a guide for moral conduct. With the Seven Cardinal Sins, Gregory the Great († 604) had created a successful alternative to the Old Testament Decalogue, which, after all, was initially intended for the Jewish people, and was part of the 613 mitzvuot (commands) of the Torah. Up to the twelfth century, this specifically Jewish heritage was an important reason why most Christian scholars cast doubt on the status of the Decalogue as a moral canon for Christians. Gregory’s list had a huge impact on medieval vernacular culture.3 However, under the influence of Augustine († 430), twelfth-century Biblical exegetes such as Hugh of Saint Victor († 1141) began decisively to change attitudes toward the Ten Commandments in Latin culture, by emphasizing their importance as a list of principles supporting morally exemplar behavior. (...) Franciscans and Dominicans (...) held the Ten Commandments in high esteem. (...) From the fourteenth century on, vernacular texts that discussed or commented upon the Decalogue came to
  the fore. By the second half of the fifteenth century, the Commandments were omnipresent in religious culture. "

- pg. 19: "Concomitant with the acceptance of the Hebrew Bible was the understanding that the Jews themselves had a place in the divine plan; as a result, they must also have a place in the contemporary world. Alone among non-Christian believers, Jews had to be treated differently, and allowed to survive. We can see this reflected in the thirteenth-century Franciscan scholar John of La
  Rochelle’s discussion of the commandment against stealing. John asks a specific question about warfare, and whether it is lawful to remove the goods of conquered enemies. As long as the war is just and you have the authority of the state behind you, you may take the goods of those you have defeated, providing you do so in a spirit of justice and not out of vengeance. Infidels or heretics can simply be despoiled of all their belongings and killed; Jews, however, must be treated more leniently. Because the Bible (Rom. 10–11) does not permit the outright killing of Jews, they must be left at least with goods sufficient for the preservation of life."

- pg. 37: "Medieval catechesis commonly emphasizes that observation of the Ten Commandments is the surest path to salvation available to the unlettered."

- pg. 39: "Thomas Aquinas (...) in his short treatise De decem praeceptis (...) presents the Decalogue as the _sine qua non_ of salvation. (...) This does not square with Aquinas’s more elaborate theological reflections elsewhere [but] results from its function—a guide for preachers to the lower classes. In other words, even though Aquinas’s understanding of the Ten Commandments was more sophisticated than appears in this treatise, he saw no problem in agreeing with his contemporaries that the Decalogue offers a sure path to salvation."

- pg. 90: "One of the enduring legacies of Reformation polemic is the myth of the indifferent medieval Church, unwilling or unable to attend to the religious instruction of the laity."

- pg. 91: "A generation of scholarship has now underscored the growing importance of the Ten Commandments in the pastoral and pedagogical programs of the Western Church long before the Reformation."

- pg. 94: "in the thirteenth century, (...) the new requirement for annual confession—promulgated by Lateran IV—stimulated the production of episcopal manuals such as that of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, which required that ‘[…] uniusque pastor animarium quilibet sacerdos parochialis sciat decalogum, id est, decem mandata legis Mosaicae; eademque populo sibi subjecto frequenter praedicat ex exponat’"

- pg. 99: "Wolff’s motivations were those of a dedicated pastor who took the sacramental obligations of the parish priest seriously. With exasperation, he noted how poorly his parishioners prepared for the task, mocking the ‘useless and empty’ confessions he regularly heard: 'Lieber herr, ich bede nit gern, ich fast nit gern, ich gee nit gern zu kyrchen, ich fluchen und schelden und sweren und byn unfridlichen mit minem man etc'."

- pg. 102: "(medieval) expositors regularly took pains to reconcile the first commandment—‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me […] nor make unto thee any graven images […]’—with the cultic practices associated with the veneration of the saints, their relics and their images. Much of this advice was more sophisticated than one might expect. Stephan von Landskron († 1477) taught for example that it was a sin for people to 'pray to carved and painted images in themselves, as if these could help them. For such images can no more help them than any other piece of painted wood. Images are there only to remind us that we should think about our Lord or his holy Passion, or about the saints whose pictures we see, to honour them and call on them to be our helpers before almighty God, who alone has the power to help us.'"

## Evelyn Waugh on the liturgical reform

[Letter to the Catholic Herald, 1964](http://www.lmschairman.org/2024/08/evelyn-waugh-on-liturgical-reform-on.html)

> "Participation" in the Mass does not mean hearing our own voices. It means God hearing our voices.

> If the Germans want to be noisy, let them. But why should they disturb our devotions?

> Of the extraneous attractions of the Church which most drew me was the spectacle of the priest and his server at low Mass, stumping up to the altar without a glance to discover how many of how few he had in his congregation; a craftsman and his apprentice; a man with a job which he alone was qualified to do.
