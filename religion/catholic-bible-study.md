## Gospel of Matthew

### Chapter 1

- Why 14 generations between Abraham and David, David and the exile, and the exile and Christ? Because 14 is the numeric value of דוד (David) in Hebrew.
- Jesus' genealogy includes four women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) who were probably not Jewish, showing an involvement of the Gentiles in salvation history.

### Chapter 2

- The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem was spared by the Persians during their invasion in 614 because they saw the mosaic of the Magi in the church and thought it was a depiction of Persian kings.
- The star of the Magi relates to Baalam's prophecy in Numbers 24:17: "A star shall advance from Jacob". (Balaam himself, of course, being a wise man from the East.) That prophecy includes a foretelling of the devastation of Edom, the land of Herod the Great's ancestors, explaining why he was so upset by the Magi's visit.
- Nature (the star) leads the Magi to Israel, Reason misdirects them to Jerusalem (where else would a king be born?), while Scripture course-corrects them to Bethlehem.
- Aquinas gives a very pragmatic explanation of the magi's gift of frankincense: the Holy Family were staying in a smelly stable, so the incense would have been a welcome gift.

### Chapter 3

- Three elements of Jesus' baptism which are also present in our own baptism, albeit in veiled form: the Heavens are opened to us, the Spirit descends, and we are accepted as God's beloved children.
- Jesus is the Elisha to John the Baptist's Elijah, commanding a double portion of the Spirit.
- Jesus is also the new Solomon, called "the Beloved" by God the Father, just as Solomon was known as "Jedidiah" (the Beloved of the Lord) in 2 Samuel 12:25.

### Chapter 4

- Jesus' humanity is shown by his hunger after fasting. Some (Arius) have taken the fact that he was "led by the Spirit" to mean that he was not fully divine, but this is rather to be understood as a reference to the Israelites' desert wanderings during which they were also led by the Spirit.
- The three temptations of Jesus parallel the three aspects of the forbidden fruit in the story of the Fall and the threefold concupiscence of 1 John 2:16: turning stones into bread to still hunger - the fruit being good for food - the lust of the flesh; throwing himself off the temple to be saved by angels - the fruit being a delight to the eyes - the lust of the eyes; and ruling over all the kingdoms of the world - the fruit being desirable to make one wise - the pride of life.
- The devil quotes Psalm 91:11-12 in his second temptation, but (understandably!) stops short of quoting verse 13: "You will tread on the lion and the adder, the young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot."
- Jesus resists the temptation to serve Satan in order to gain the kingdoms of the world, unlike the Antichrist who will do exactly that.

### Chapter 5

- The images of salt and light are connected to the Temple, where offerings were salted and the menorah was kept burning. They are also connected to Jesus' Galilean home, which was famous for its salted fish and its olive oil.
- 5:18 says that not even the smallest part of the Law will go away "until all is accomplished" (ἕως ἂν πάντα γένηται). Compare this to 28:11, where the guard tells the chief priests "all that had taken place" (ἅπαντα τὰ γενόμενα): the Greek verb is the same in both cases. This suggests that Jesus' death may be the "accomplishment" referred to in 5:18, which would mean that _after_ Jesus' death, the Law can/will change.
- The image of going to a sacrifice while bearing a grudge against someone may well be a reference to the story of Cain and Abel.

### Chapter 6

- Three spiritual practices: almsgiving, prayer and fasting. These are the antidotes to the three temptations in the desert: almsgiving cures from greed, prayer from pride, and fasting from gluttony.
- Private prayer is essential ("go to your room and close the door"), but so is communal prayer ("_our_ Father").

### Chapter 7

- Golden Rule: cf the story of Rabbi Hillel, who was asked to recite the whole of the Law while standing on one foot. He replied: "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbour. That is the whole of the Law. Everything else is commentary." But note that Jesus uses the positive formulation, which is rather more demanding.
- The two ways parallel the choice given by Moses in Deuteronomy 30:15-20: "I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Choose life, then, that you and your descendants may live, by loving the Lord, your God, obeying his voice, and holding fast to him."

### Chapter 8

- In this chapter and the next, Jesus performs ten miracles, which parallel and contrast with the ten plagues of Egypt.
- Jesus cleansing the leper: cf the story of Elisha and Naaman in 2 Kings 5, where the king of Israel avers that only God can cure leprosy. Similarly, the Dead Sea Scrolls predict miracles that will be performed by the Messiah which map quite neatly onto the miracles of Jesus, but healing leprosy is not among them. This suggests that the healing of leprosy is a sign of Jesus' divinity.
- "Let the dead bury their dead": Jesus' call is even more urgent than the call of Elijah in 1 Kings 19:19-21, who allowed Elisha to go back and say goodbye to his family.
- The herd of swine may be an allusion to the boar mascot of the Legio X Fretensis, the Roman legion stationed in the Decapolis.

### Chapter 9

- The paralytic is healed because of the faith of the people who brought him to Jesus, not his own faith. This has been interpreted as a symbol of (infant) baptism, where the faith of the parents stands in for the faith of the child.
- "that you may know": parallel to the story of the plagues in Exodus, where the plagues are performed "that you may know that I am the Lord".
- The image of not fasting while the bridegroom is with them is a reference to a custom among the Pharisees, who fasted on Mondays and Thursdays, except during a wedding, which usually lasted a whole week.
- When Jesus is called to heal the daughter of the synagogue official, he is interrupted by the woman with the hemorrhage, whom he heals first. This is perhaps an implicit contrast with the story of Elisha when he is called to heal the son of the Shunamite woman and sends his servant Gehazi ahead, bidding him to avoid any distraction (2 Kings 4:29: "If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not reply."). And while Elisha prays to God and performs an elaborate ritual to raise the child, Jesus simply takes her by the hand and raises her by his own authority.
- "Like sheep without a shepherd": a reference to the prophecy of Ezekiel 34, where the Lord promises to be the shepherd of his people, since their human shepherds have failed them. Jesus resolves a tension in Ezekiel, where the promised shepherd is alternatively identified as God himself and as David, since he is both.

### Chapter 10

- Twelve apostles to represent the twelve tribes of Israel, including even the ten lost tribes. When he first calls them, they are not called apostles yet, but disciples. The title "apostle" is only given to them after they have been sent out on a mission.
- The injunction not to worry about what to say when brought before the authorities does not imply that a disciple of Jesus should not learn about the faith (cf 1 Peter 3:15), but rather that the Holy Spirit will help them if they don't have time to prepare.
- The warning that Jesus has come to bring a sword and to set family members against each other is a reference to Micah 7:6: "For the son treats the father with contempt, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house."

### Chapter 11

- Aquinas interprets John the Baptist's question as a rhetorical one, asked not because he doesn't know the answer, but in order to draw out the answer from Jesus for the benefit of his disciples. St John Paul II cites it as an example of faith seeking understanding: John believes that Jesus is the Messiah, but he wants to understand why Jesus is not acting like the Messiah he expected.
- Jesus' answer draws together several prophecies from Isaiah, but leaves out the one about setting prisoners free. This is because John is still in prison, and Jesus knows that he will die there.
- The reference to "a reed swayed by the wind" is a reference to the coinage of Herod Antipas, who minted coins with a reed to symbolise his capital city of Tiberias on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.
- The Galilean villages of Chorazin and Bethsaida are likened to Tyre and Sidon, gentile cities. In Bethsaida's case this might be because it was a relatively Hellenised village compared to Capernaum, which was more Jewish.
- Jesus' yoke is easy, unlike the yoke imposed on Israel by Solomon and his son Rehoboam, which led to the falling away of the ten tribes of the North, in whose historical territory Jesus is now preaching.

### Chapter 12

- Jesus invokes the exception being made for priests to work on the Sabbath in reference to his disciples' plucking of grain. This implies, of course, that his disciples are priests.
- The reference to "their" synagogue has been taken as evidence that Matthew was written after the destruction of the Temple, when the Christians had been expelled from the synagogues. However, it might just as well refer to a synagogue for a particular group of Jews, in this case the Pharisees. This would help explain the rhetorical question in what follows: "Who among you, if your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?" Among an audience of Pharisees, the answer would be "no one", but other groups like the Essenes might have answered differently (cf the Damascus Document, which does not allow for assisting a birthing animal on the Sabbath).
- In the healing of the man with the withered hand, note that Jesus asks him to do the impossible: "Stretch out your hand." This correlates nicely with (St Paul and) St Augustine's teaching that God always provides the grace to do what he commands, even if it is impossible for us to do it on our own.

### Chapter 13

- Jesus only starts teaching in parables after being rejected. The parables are not meant to make things clearer, but to hide them from those who are not ready to receive them. He teaches in parables "outside the house" (q.d., of Peter = the Church), but explains them to his disciples "inside the house".
- Common theme of these parables: the Kingdom of God starts small and is hidden, which is at odds with contemporaneous Jewish expectations of a triumphal Messianic kingdom.
- In the parable of the sower, three types of soil accept the seed and bear fruit to some extent, though not all equally well; these correspond to the thirty, sixty and hundredfold yield.
- The parable of the wheat and the tares suggests that the Kingdom of God is not an eschatological paradise in heaven, but refers to a present reality, the Church. Otherwise, how could there be sinners to eliminate "from the Kingdom"?
- In the contrast of the sinners who are thrown into the fiery furnace and the righteous who shine like the sun, consider this: which is hotter, the furnace or the sun? The damned wouldn't be able to withstand the fiery brilliance of God's presence. There is also a foreshadowing here of the Transfiguration, where Jesus' face shines like the sun and his clothes become white as light.

### Chapter 14

- In the story of the death of John the Baptist, the theme of a birthday celebration leading to an execution is a clear echo of the story of Pharao's birthday celebration in Genesis 40.
- More subtly, this also continue the parallel between John the Baptist and Elijah, both of whom have to contend with a wicked king whose wife who wants to kill them. Taking this parallel a bit further, we note that just as after Elijah's being taken up into heaven, Elisha performs a double portion of his miracles, so after John's death, Jesus performs even greater miracles, and the first one of these reported in this chapter, the feeding of the five thousand, clearly parallels the feeding of the hundred by Elisha in 2 Kings 4.
- The feeding of the five thousand happens "in a deserted place", just like the feeding of the Israelites in the desert. The bread evokes the manna, while the fish (more indirectly) points to the quail which were brought up by a wind "from the sea" (Numbers 11:31) after Moses complains that there wouldn't be enough food to feed the Israelites "if all the fish in the sea were caught for them" (Numbers 11:22).
- Jesus does not feed the crowd directly, but through the agency of the disciples, foreshadowing the role of the priest in dispensing the Eucharist. But right after this he sends the disciples away _before_ dismissing the crowd and puts them in a situation they cannot handle on their own, preventing them from cashing in on their popularity and reminding them of their ultimate reliance on him.
- Jesus coming in the "fourth watch of the night" might be a subtle allusion to the Son of Man in Daniel coming during the fourth kingdom.
- Jesus walking on the water and calming the storm has rich connections to the Psalms (Psalm 69 and 107 in particular) and to the Book of Job, where God is identified as the one who "trampled the waves of the sea" (Job 9:8).

### Chapter 15

- The Gentile woman is described as a "Canaanite", a term which had been obsolete for over a thousand years by the time Matthew was written. She refers to Jesus as "Son of David", with David being the king who finally conquered the Canaanites.
- The feeding of the four thousand is a parallel to the feeding of the five thousand, but this time the crowd is Gentile rather than Jewish, as indicated by the different words used for the baskets left over: κοφίνους for the five thousand vs σπυρίδας for the four thousand. Another subtle difference is the word used for "blessing": εὐλογεῖν for the five thousand vs εὐχαριστεῖν for the four thousand. While initially synonymous, from the second century onwards, εὐχαριστεῖν became associated with the Eucharist and hence Christianity, so Jews started using εὐλογεῖν instead.

### Chapter 16

- In response to Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the Living God, Jesus answers in an almost entirely parallel way, labelling Simon as Peter, the Son of Jonah.
- The parallel with Jonah is significant: just as Jonah was sent by God into the capital of Israel's enemy Assyria and managed to convert them, so Peter will be sent into the capital of Israel's enemy Rome and manage to convert them. (And of course we know from the Gospel of John that Peter's father wasn't named Jonah at all, but Jochanan, so this is clearly symbolic.)
- The emphasis on the "living" God may be in contrast to the idols whose temples were found in Caesarea Philippi, and also closely parallels the question asked by Caiaphas before the Sanhedrin: "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." (Matthew 26:63)
- As Origen observes, Jesus gives Peter authority to bind and loοse in the Heavens (plural), while later on a similar authority is given to the disciples, but only in reference to Heaven (singular). This may just be down to the fact that the Hebrew word for Heaven, שמים, is a dual/plural form, as is its Aramaic equivalent ܫܡܝܐ, but it may also indicate a special status for Peter.
- But even Peter's special authority does not allow him to go against God's will, as exemplified in the rebuke he gets from Jesus immediately afterwards when he protests against the first prophecy of his passion. One wonders whether Peter's confession would have been quite to forthright if he had realised that Jesus would soon go to his death and leave him in charge.
- "Get thee behind me, Satan" - the Greek for "behind me" is "ὀπίσω μου", which is the same phrase used in the calling of Peter in Matthew 4:19: he is not telling Peter to go away (like he did to Satan in the desert: "ὕπαγε", Matthew 4:10), but to fall in line.
- Jesus calls Peter a σκάνδαλον, literally a "stumbling stone", just a few verses after naming him "Rock" (Petros, Πέτρος).
- Jesus' foretelling of his being handed over to the Gentiles to be killed and rising after three days also has some parallels with Daniel 7:25, where the saints are given into the hands of the fourth beast for a time and times and half a time.

### Chapter 17

- The presence of Moses and Elijah in the transfiguration is a reference to the Law and the Prophets. Also, both Moses and Elijah got very close to seeing God, but ultimately were denied this privilege, Moses seeing God from behind and Elijah sensing his presence in the gentle breeze; now they finally get to see him face to face. For Moses, this is additionally a fulfilment of his longing to enter the Promised Land, which he was forbidden to do during his lifetime.
- There are parallels between Moses ascending Mount Sinai to receive the Law and Jesus ascending Mount Tabor to be transfigured. For example, both ascend on the seventh day, and both take three companions. Jesus' face shines like the sun, similar to Moses' face shining after his descent from Mount Sinai.
- In a practical application of the power of the keys, Peter (hastily?) commits Jesus to paying the temple tax, and he obliges, but in a way that preserves his special status as the Son of the King (= God) to whom the tax is owed.

### Chapter 18

- The hyperbolic language of cutting off one's hand or foot or plucking out one's eye may be a reference to the story of the Maccabean martyrs in 2 Maccabees 7, who prefer the loss of their limbs to the loss of their souls.
- The story of the unforgiving servant contains what has been interpreted as an oblique reference to purgatory: the servant is thrown into prison until he pays back his debt, which is impossible for him to do. This is a reference to the doctrine of the Church that some sins can be forgiven in the next life, but only after a period of purification.

### Chapter 19

- Jesus' teaching on divorce is given in the Transjordan, which is doubly significant: first, because it is the territory of Herodes Antipas, who had John the Baptist killed for criticising his divorce and remarriage; and second, because it is the place where Moses gave his discourse on the Law in Deuteronomy, allowing divorce which had not previously been mentioned.
- The rabbis' teachings on divorce were various, with Shammai only allowing it in case of adultery, Hillel for spoiling a meal, and Akiva even for finding a prettier wife.
- The proviso of "εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ" has been interpreted as referring to incestuous relationships where the marriage was never valid in the first place, though this seems to be a modern interpretation. The more traditional interpretation is that there may be cases where a civil divorce is licit, but the marriage bond remains in the eyes of God and hence remarriage is always excluded. This interpretation has the support even of Protestant scholars like Ulrich Luz.
- From his discussion of marriage, Jesus moves on to a discussion of celibacy. His teachings on both of these subjects are hard: οὐ πάντες χωροῦσιν τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, and ὁ δυνάμενος χωρεῖν χωρείτω.
- In the story of the rich young man who asks Jesus which commandments he must keep to inherit eternal life, Jesus answers with a list of commandments exclusively from the second tablet of the decalogue, which are all about loving one's neighbour. His added commandment to sell all one's possessions may be understood as summarising the first tablet of the decalogue, about loving God more than anything else.
- The odd turn of phrase in 19:24, "εὐκοπώτερόν ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τρήματος ῥαφίδος διελθεῖν" has been interpreted (e.g., by St Thomas More) as a scribe's error mistaking κάμιλον (rope) for κάμηλον (camel).

### Chapter 20

- The parable of the workers in the vineyard can in context be understood in two ways: either as referring back to the rich young man, indicating that he might yet have a change of heart and be saved, or as a warning to the disciples that they should not be haughty even though they were called first.
- It does not devalue work, but shows that God can take our own insufficient efforts and perfect them.
- The request of the mother of James and John that her sons be seated at Jesus' right and left hand in his kingdom does not necessarily refer to the end of days. The one other time in the Gospel of Matthew that she is mentioned in connection with someone to the right and the left of Jesus is at the crucifixion, where the two thieves are crucified to his right and left. She does not know what she is asking for!
