> **Al Maidah** 18: "The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!” Say, O Prophet, “Why then does He punish you for your sins?"

Contrast Proverbs 3:12: "The Lord reproves him who he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights."

> **Yunus** 90-91: "We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them unjustly and oppressively. But as Pharaoh was drowning, he cried out, 'I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am now one of those who submit.' He was told, 'Now you believe? But you always disobeyed and were one of the corruptors.'"

No deathbed conversion in the Quran?

> **Ar-Ra'd** 14: "Those idols the pagans invoke besides Him can never respond to them in any way. It is just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, asking it to reach their mouths, but it can never do so."

Lovely image!
