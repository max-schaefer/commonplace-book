# John Henry Newman: Apologia Pro Vita Sua

## Preface

> False ideas may be refuted indeed by argument, but by true ideas alone are they expelled.

## From 1833 to 1839

> We meet with truths overstated or misdirected, matters of detail variously taken, facts incompletely proved or applied, and rules inconsistently urged or discordantly interpreted.

## From 1839 to 1841

> now here, in the middle of the fifth century, I found, as it seemed to me, Christendom of the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries reflected. I saw my face in that mirror, and I was a Monophysite. The Church of the _Via Media_ was in the position of the Oriental communion, Rome was where she now is; and the Protestants were the Eutychians.

## From 1841 to 1845

> Am I alone, of Englishmen, not to have the privilege to go where I will, no question asked?

> The Catholic Church allows no image of any sort, material or immaterial, no dogmatic symbol, no rite, no sacrament, no Saint, not even the Blessed Virgin, to come between the soul and its Creator.

> I was angry with the Anglican divines. I thought they had taken me in; I had read the Fathers with their eyes; I had sometimes trusted their quotations or their reasonins, and from reliance on them, I had used words or made statements, which by right I ought rigidly to have examined myself. I had thought myself safe, while I had their warrant for what I said. I had exercised more faith than criticism in the matter.

## Position of my Mind since 1845

> Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt, as I understand the subject; difficulty and doubt are incommensurate.
