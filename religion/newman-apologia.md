# John Henry Newman: Apologia Pro Vita Sua

## Preface

> False ideas may be refuted indeed by argument, but by true ideas alone are they expelled.

## From 1833 to 1839

> We meet with truths overstated or misdirected, matters of detail variously taken, facts incompletely proved or applied, and rules inconsistently urged or discordantly interpreted.
