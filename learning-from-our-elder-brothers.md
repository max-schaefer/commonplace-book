# Learning from our Elder Brothers

A collection of notes on the Tanakh gleaned from Jewish podcasts, specifically Alex Israel's [Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4Qu9OF1UY1Zia0zBMoCw7v?si=b87a56d76cf442fc) and Jonathan Livi's [Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/45srXeZZgZKHAomOmpIkmh?si=0405a8b93eb24591).

## Exodus

### Parashah Terumah (Exodus 25:1-27:19)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1UpDsdabywQyc11onGMUi1?si=7af05dd606134aef): The instructions to build the altar and the table are given in the singular, whereas the instruction to build the ark is in the plural.[^1] In Midrashic interpretation, the altar is associated with the high priest and the table with the king, of which there is only one; the ark, on the other hand, is associated with the Torah, which is for everyone.

[^1]: So also in the Vulgate, but interestingly not in the Septuagint, which has the singular in all three cases.

### Parashah Ki Tisa (Exodus 30:11-34:35)

[The Parashah Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VjuzVqGKOmgzuUzewYd9l?si=w1SOst7TQKOIW1zua0jg9g): "As for the man Moses" (Exodus 32:1) may be a realisation on part of the people of Israel that Moses is not a God after all. Steeped in Egyptian culture, they may have assumed that Moses was a God like Pharaoh, and the realisation that he was not sent them looking for a replacement.

"Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt" (Exodus 32:7) harks back to the story of the Flood, where "all the people on the earth had corrupted their ways" (Genesis 6:12). In both cases God decides to destroy the people and start over with Moses/Noah, but unlike Noah, who just accepted God's decision and the destruction it entailed, Moses argues with God and convinces him to change his mind.

## 2 Kings

### Chapter 2

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0QGxEug5Y4uuNqlTbXj3aJ?si=425b35b426444c00): When Elisha asks Elijah in v9 to "let me inherit a double portion of your spirit", he is asking to be treated as the firstborn. Elijah had many disciples (as this chapter shows) who, as his spiritual children, inherit his spirit, but Elisha gets a double portion of the inheritance.

### Chapter 19

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0KKL9E29oRa51ntcVl5Emy?si=db2139acc45a47aa): Sennacherib’s siege of Jerusalem is described on the Taylor Prism, where he says that he shut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem like a "caged bird". Now cf Isaiah 31:5: "Like birds hovering overhead, the Lord Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it." (NIV) For more than 2000 years one would have read this as a bland, general association of birds with freedom, but thanks to modern archaeology we can now see that it was perhaps a pointed rebuttal of Assyrian propaganda.

## Isaiah

### Chapter 7

[The Tanakh Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3vCN4T36fGN4bDzkDEbB3V?si=32db0f76a9224334): "That verse" is simply interpreted as an emphasis that the threat of a combined Aramean/Northern invasion will go away very soon: a woman will give birth to a child, and before that child is old enough to choose right over wrong, the enemies’ country will be devastated. It’s an elegant interpretation, but I feel like a bit too much is said about the child for it to just serve as a measure of time.
